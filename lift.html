                <h3>Tips to make your nutrition work for your goals.</h3>
                <div class="tips">
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">Consistency is King</h3>
                    <p>Any diet can work in the short term - our bodies do best when
                        we provide them with what they need, consistently. That is not 
                        to say you should be striving for perfection all of the time. 
                        Quite the opposite - the key to consistency is balance. You need
                        to make sure that you are ENJOYING your life, or you will burn 
                        out on your lifestyle - no matter how successful it may feel. 
                        Aim for being on track with your goals 80% of the time. Allow 
                        yourself the other 20% to find the space to enjoy your life. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">Progress, Not Perfection</h3>
                    <p>Something is ALWAYS better than nothing. As mentioned above, 
                        perfection is not the goal, and in fact it often sets you up 
                        for failure. Sounds counter-intuitive, right? If you have goals, 
                        it can make sense to put all your effort into making sure you are
                        hitting the landmarks to reach the goal. However, if we hold ourselves
                        to an impossible standard we are dooming our efforts. The minute that
                        life happens - and, newsflash, life is GOING to happen - we give up.
                        We feel like failures. We think that because we stepped out of line,
                        all hope is lost. This can take a few different paths. A common one
                        is the case of the fuck-its. You think "well since I've already gone
                        off the rails, I might as well go all the way and enjoy the ride." 
                        Another common one is beating yourself up. That can end up causing
                        you to double down even harder on your efforts. These are both 
                        unfortunate extremes and neither lend themselves to long term success.
                        When life happens, shake it off and move on. No need to think about  
                        what if you had done this, or that, or hadn't let it go for several 
                        days/weeks/months. Just shake it off. Move on. A tiny blip on the radar
                        is not going to be the downfall of all of your progress. Letting yourself
                        go totally off plan for months out of guilt and shame is going to hinder
                        your goals. Focus on the fact that you have made progress, and be proud 
                        of your work. Remember that perfection is not attainable, nor sustainable.
                        Every decision you make is a choice to align yourself with your goals. Sometimes we
                        are going to make the choices that don't align us with those goals, but if we manage to
                        make the ones that do more often than not, we're going to get there. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">Move the Big Rocks</h3>
                    <p>Focus on what is going to have the largest impact. This means that most of
                        your efforts should be placed on making sure you're taking in the right
                        amount of food for your goals, then making sure the macronutrient balance 
                        is right for you, then food quality, then timing, then supplements. Spending
                        time and energy on dialing in supplements if you are under-eating is not 
                        going to be of much benefit. There is room for that when everything else 
                        has been pretty much sorted out, but the main priorities need to be the 
                        main priorities.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">Don't Overflow the Bucket</h3>
                    <p>Remember that each of the things you put into the bucket add up. Look at
                        your life overall. Think of stressors you have at home, work, with your 
                        training (yes, training is a stress, even if you enjoy it). Take a look at
                        your recovery: are you sleeping? are you eating enough? are you often sore?
                        are you spending time in nature? If your body is busy dealing with the 
                        overflowing bucket, it cannot deal with the additional stress you are adding
                        to it by expecting it to magically shed weight or put on muscle. Think of
                        your body as a precious vessel - it needs to be cared for and loved. Get 
                        the water level down to a manageable level and then you can worry about how to
                        achieve the next big goal on your list. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">Food Quality is Important</h3>
                    <p>You are literally made up of what you consume. Seeking out minimally processed
                        foods is doing your body many favors. The earth provides us with what we need 
                        in order to thrive. That's not to say we cannot indulge in junk every now and then,
                        but the majority of your diet should come from foods that are not incredibly hard
                        for your body to digest. This makes breaking them down into usable energy far 
                        easier - and it makes the systems within your body function in a more optimal way. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">Pay it Forward to Your Future Self</h3>
                    <p>Being on top of your nutrition can seem boring. Planning. Meal prep. Structure. Routine.
                        But I like to think of it as setting myself up for success. I know that if I spend time
                        grocery shopping, planning my meals, and then prepping them on the weekends for the week
                        ahead, I have a significantly easier time than if I fly by the seat of my pants and hope
                        for the best. If you're saying you don't have time to meal prep, I challenge you to examine
                        what you DO have time for. If you take a look at your calendar and legitimately cannot 
                        find an hour a week to set aside, then I suggest looking into meal services, or buying
                        low-cost easy options at the grocery store such as rotisserie chicken, frozen veggies, 
                        and pre-cooked pouches of rice. During the week when you're short on time and hungry,
                        you can make a note to hop in your Delorean and go back to thank your past self for 
                        setting you up for success.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">Focus on What You CAN Do.</h3>
                    <p>Many times people feel overwhelmed by the thought of starting down a journey towards their 
                        goals. It can be intimidating and scary to change your life - even a little bit. This can come
                        out as making excuses about how we can't manage to make time for something, or we don't have the 
                        money, or the resources, or the right pair of leggings. It can feel like panic. Take a breath, 
                        remember that your brain is going to always encourage you to take the easier path. Your brain 
                        does not want you to do the harder thing unless you have to - it's just a survival mechanism.
                        This is where you need to have a little inner dialogue and help yourself focus on what matters. 
                        Maybe you don't have the amount of time, money, right pair of leggings, etc. for whatever that next
                        goal is...but you do have something. Focus on that. Focus on how much time you DO have. How much 
                        money CAN you spend? How can you achieve something similar with NO money if that is what it takes?
                        Allow yourself to realize it's not black and white. There is always something you CAN do. Even if 
                        it feels hopeless and like you're standing at the foot of a mountain. Take one step. Don't worry
                        about the one after that until the first one is complete. That is how you get to the top.
