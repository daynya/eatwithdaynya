                    I currently offer 1-on-1 nutrition coaching. This is kicked off 
                    by you filling out a thorough intake form giving me some details 
                    about your goals, lifestyle and current habits. Then we jump on 
                    a zoom (or phone) call to answer any questions you may have, and
                    get to know each other. Once I have all of your info, I can put
                    together a general program for how to proceed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each week, we will check-in via email. I am available for support
                    outside of our weekly check-ins, so you always have the ability 
                    to ask questions, get guidance, or just share your accomplishments
                    with me!
                </p>
