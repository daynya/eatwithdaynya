                    Hi, I'm Daynya. I comes by my love for nutrition honestly. 
                    After years of not taking care of myself, I had a wake-up call
                    and realized that I needed to get my health on track. I started 
                    learning about nutrition, and experimenting with what felt good 
                    for my body. Through this process I discovered fitness, 
                    and I've spent the last 20 years figuring out how these two work
                    together. With a significant amount of self study and experimenting
                    with different ways of eating, as well figuring out how my body likes
                    to move, I started to feel aligned with my true self. On this journey,
                    I have found a deep passion for learning what makes people thrive 
                    instead of survive. After getting requests for advice from many friends
                    and family members, I finally launched into a proper certification to
                    become a nutrition coach in order to be of better service to my community
                    and spread my love of nutrition.
                </p>

                    If you are someone who is curious, open, and ready to make a change 
                    in your life, maybe we should work together. Whether you are seeking 
                    better athletic performance,  weight loss, weight gain, or improved 
                    health, I would love to be by your side and help you achieve
                    your goals. With so much conflicting nutrition information in the world, 
                    I am making it my mission to help clients learn how to achieve results 
                    by tuning out the noise and learning about themselves, and what works 
                    for them. I am passionate about food quality. In sports nutrition 
                    especially, quality is often put on the back burner and focus is mostly
                    placed on macros. Food is literally what makes up our bodies, and I 
                    believe in gentle encouragement to get everyone who I meet to eat just a 
                    little better than how they did when she found them.

                    Outside of nutrition, I am a competitive powerlifter and a yogi. 
                    I am a software developer, artist, wife and pet-mom who loves to be 
                    out in the sunshine, grow my own veggies, and cook as much as humanly 
                    possible. You can often find me in the sun with a giant water bottle, 
                    reading a book about food.
