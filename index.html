                <div class="tips">
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">What is the best diet?</h3>
                    <p>The best diet is the one you can follow consistently. You can achieve 
                        short term success with any number of restrictive eating methods. 
                        What we're looking for is what you can do repeatedly,consistently, 
                        and sustainably. What is a way of eating that not only supports your 
                        goals, but also supports your lifestyle? 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">There are no shortcuts</h3>
                    <p>So often we buy into the hype that is displayed in media or online and 
                        we want to find a quick fix. Unfortunately, there are not any quick fixes
                        that actually fix anything at all. Showing up every day and doing the work 
                        can feel boring and hard, but that is the only true shortcut to your goals. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">Consistency is King</h3>
                    <p>Any diet can work in the short term, but our bodies do best when
                        we provide them with what they need, consistently. That is not 
                        to say you should be striving for perfection all of the time. 
                        Quite the opposite - the key to consistency is balance. You need
                        to make sure that you are ENJOYING your life, or you will burn 
                        out on your lifestyle - no matter how successful it may feel. 
                        Aim for being on track with your goals 80% of the time. Allow 
                        yourself the other 20% to find the space to enjoy your life. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">You may not be eating enough</h3>
                    <p>If you are constantly hungry, tired or sore, you probably are not 
                        giving your body the fuel that it needs. Nutrition is one of the top
                        ways to support recovery from workouts. The amount of food needed 
                        is very individual, but there are often ways to ramp up your intake 
                        while still working towards your goals.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">Carbs are not evil</h3>
                    <p>Carbohydrates support our energetic processes better than any other nutrients
                        we consume. Our bodies are very good at adapting to what we feed them, but 
                        long term health and success for MOST people means a healthy dose of carbs in 
                        the daily diet. If you have been avoiding carbs out of fear of gaining weight or
                        because you think they are unhealthy, I urge you to reconsider. There is a small 
                        group of people for whom carbs can cause health issues, but for the most part we 
                        all benefit from consuming carbs pre and post workout.  
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="caps-heading">Supplement Last</h3>
                    <p>There are some great supplements out there that most people can benefit from 
                        adding into their diet. But these are to fill the gaps. The majority of our 
                        nutrients should be coming from whole foods. Focus your efforts on getting your 
                        micro and macronutrients from your diet, and then if there are things that are 
                        missing, add in supplements to round things out.
                    </p>
